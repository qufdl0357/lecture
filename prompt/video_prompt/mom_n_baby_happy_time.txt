A realistic animation starting from a photo of a woman in a green dinosaur costume holding a baby in a matching outfit. 
The woman gently kisses the baby on the cheek, then lifts the baby high into the air with both hands, playfully flying them like an airplane. 
The baby’s arms stretch outward as they move through the air. 
The scene is warm, playful, and full of affection, set in a softly lit indoor space with cozy atmosphere. 
Focus on costume textures, movement, and emotional tone—no detailed facial features needed.
