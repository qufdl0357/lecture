The mage stands still in the forest, eyes closed, as the magic orb begins to glow brighter. Leaves swirl gently around her feet. She opens the ancient book, and glowing runes rise from the pages, floating in the air. Her eyes snap open, now glowing with arcane energy.
The orb levitates above her palm, spinning slowly, casting light patterns onto the trees. A gust of wind lifts her cloak slightly. The forest around her responds â€” branches tremble, animals pause, and a faint hum fills the air.
Stylized with ethereal lighting, particle effects, and soft camera focus to create a mystical atmosphere.
The camera circles around her as the runes rise and the orb glows, emphasizing the magical energy field.
